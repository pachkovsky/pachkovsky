With over 14 years of experience as a full-stack software engineer, I have established a track record of success in the field. My expertise lies in crafting web applications utilizing Ruby on Rails and JavaScript, with a versatile background encompassing roles in both outsourcing and product-based companies. My skill set is characterized by the ability to develop responsive and functional frontends, create secure and scalable backends, and implement robust CI/CD pipelines.

I excel in constructing integrations with third-party APIs and am a staunch advocate for comprehensive test coverage and automated end-to-end testing. Beyond my technical prowess, I am adept at team management and am equally capable of operating independently as a self-reliant, autonomous engineer. My agility as a quick learner enables me to swiftly adapt to new environments and emerging technologies.
