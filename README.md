As a full-stack software engineer with over 13 years of experience, I have a proven track record of successfully building web applications using Ruby on Rails and JavaScript. I have worked in both outsourcing and product-based companies, and have developed
a strong skill set in creating responsive and functional frontend, secure and scalable backend, and setting up CI/CD pipelines. Iam also skilled in building integrations with
third-party APIs and am an advocate for comprehensive test coverage and automated end-to-end testing. In addition to my technical expertise, I am capable of managing a team or working independently as a self-sufficient, autonomous engineer. Iam also a
fast learner and adapt quickly to new environments and technologies.
